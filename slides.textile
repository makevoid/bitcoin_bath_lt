Why bitcoin is better

---


Why Bitcoin is better

- push vs pull
- micro donations
- meet the reference client


---

Push vs Pull

---

Long polling vs websockets


---

> it sucks, not only as a technology but think also about TRUST and MONEY

> go to a shop and you are trusting the guy at the shop, the shop POS system or

> the website's iframe, the ssl certificate, the device, the connection, the site or payment system to store your infos

>  !!!you have to login to check your balance

---

Public key cryptography

---

Make as many accounts you want

---

Generate one time accounts (wallets / keypairs) offline and keep them offline 


> so it's unhackable


---


Micropayments (donations)

---

No fees

---

H2. 20p

The fee for every CC transaction is 20p!

> minimum 5 pounds at the shop or ill charge you 50p more

---

1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC

---

1 mBTC = x GBP

1 Â£ = x mBTC


---


But the price doesn't matter


---

Bitcoin is an awesome piece of technology
