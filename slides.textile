Why Bitcoin is "better"

---


Why Bitcoin is "better"

- push vs pull
- micro donations
- meet the reference client


---

Push vs Pull


---

Long polling vs websockets


> public / private key pair


---

> it sucks, not only as a technology but think also about TRUST and MONEY <br> go to a shop and you are trusting the guy at the shop, the shop POS system or <br> the website's iframe, the ssl certificate, the device, the connection, the site or payment system to store your infos <br> !!!you have to login to check your balance



---

h2. Public key cryptography

(asymmetric)

---

Make as many accounts you want

---

Generate one time accounts (wallets / keypairs) offline and keep them offline


> so it's not hackable if you print it on paper


---


Why Bitcoin is "better"

- push vs pull
- **micro donations**
- meet the reference client


---

Micropayments (donations)

---

No fees

---

h2. 20p

The fee for every CC transaction is 20p!

> minimum 5 pounds at the shop "or I'll charge you 50p more"

---

1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC


> tere's no point to talk about Bitcoins --- luckily we have Millibits!

---

1 mBTC = ~0.2 GBP

<br>
<br>

1 Â£ = ~5 mBTC


> this is the current price, but the price doesn't matter! The cool thing is the technology!

---
